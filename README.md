## Koos Rooijers - Researcher at Sanquin

Currently working on proteomics data analysis.
- clustering peptides and merging samples across datasets, using graph algorithms
- applying Bayesian modeling to
  - handle missing values in data
  - deal with missing samples (or, unbalanced designs)
  - extract biologically meaningful metrics, from complex experimental setups
  - obtain credible intervals for those, reduce false positives

If you have found this page through interest for proteomics analysis workflows and want to collaborate or use the code:
- don't hesitate to reach out, either on github or by email
- repositories will be made available Soonâ„¢
